##  Project Summary
This Pentaho project orchestrates the integration and refinement of data from diverse sources, including manual input, text files, Excel files, folders, and zip files. The dataset comprises essential fields such as 'Customer ID,' 'Customer Name,' 'Segment,' 'Age,' 'Country,' 'City,' 'State,' 'Postal Code,' and 'Region.' The initial step involves sorting the data based on 'Customer ID' for organized processing, followed by merging using the 'Sorted Merge' property to consolidate the datasets seamlessly. Duplicate entries are subsequently eliminated using the 'Unique Rows' property to ensure data integrity.

Addressing inconsistencies in the 'Country' field, where variations like 'US' and 'USA' coexist, is crucial for data standardization. The 'Value Mapper' property is applied to unify the country names under 'United States.' Moreover, the presence of '#' symbols in certain 'City' entries is rectified using the 'Replace In String' property.

To enhance data accuracy, the 'Fuzzy Match' property is employed to correct misspelled entries in the 'State' field, ensuring uniformity. Handling the 'Age' field involves parsing mixed data types, separating strings from integers using the 'Select Values' property. String ages are converted to integers, and negative values are normalized to their absolute counterparts using the 'Calculator' property.
Following data cleaning operations, the datasets are merged again using the 'Sorted Merge' property based on 'Customer ID' in ascending order. Additionally, complete addresses are generated by concatenating 'City,' 'State,' 'Country,' and 'Postal Code' fields using the 'Concat Fields' property.

Lastly, insights into data distribution are gained by counting rows with identical 'State' and 'Segment' attributes using the 'Memory Group By' feature, providing valuable analytical insights.

In summary, this Pentaho project exemplifies meticulous data integration, cleansing, and enrichment techniques, ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and analytical robustness for downstream processes and analysis.
